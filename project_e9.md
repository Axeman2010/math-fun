prime factorisation
fundamental theorem of arithmetic
and m/n method for construction of primitive pythagorean triplets

then you solve

cN(N+M) = 500 for some N & M which are factors of the RHS

c is a constant. N/M method only produces primitive pythagorean triplets so c is there incase you require a non primitive pi triplet. since RHS is small and the N/M method for small numbers will by nature require a small N. By inspection you can work out that c is 1.

a = 375
b = 200
c = 425

a + b + c = 1000

and abc = 31875000
