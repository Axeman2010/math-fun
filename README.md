# math-fun
This repository primarily contains solutions to [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) problems.
Solutions are in the projects folder and the file name project_e(number) refers to which problem the solution is for.
Some problems require inputs and they can be found under the inputs_for_problems directory.

specs folder contains tests for a variety of Project Euler problems that required multiple methods.

useful_methods directory contains methods which I have found myself re-writing to solve Mathematical challenges.
They have their own dedicated spec folder to test them so that they can be kept separate.

Any files which are one off cases have been kept in the main directory which I will move further down the line.
